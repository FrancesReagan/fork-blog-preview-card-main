How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
Using Figma designs as a reference affected my coding process as in many ways it made the code more visual to me; as a new coder, having the visual next to the CSS code that it 
generated was helpful at times. Also, having the exact measurements, colors, et. al specs was most helpful for this activity and future projects as the design components
are standardized for the project, making it easier to have a consistent outcome. 

What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?  The challenges I had were the same as before,  namely, I am new to software engineering, and so it may take me a longer time to understand and implement code and how to use it based on what I see in the design. Once I am more adept at knowing how the visuals would
in general translate into code, the better I will be at implementing the desired outcome of the design. It is something to look forward to the day I can freely design and understand 
quickly, and code efficiently the outcome.

How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
Feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor can help me improve as a developer, as I can post requests for help on problems I am running up against in the code, and others who are more advanced can suggest how to go about resolving the issue.  As there are fun projects to do, which makes me a better developer with the more practice I 
get, the better I get at web development.
